# Crop Disease Identification System - Project Statement

## Problem Statement
Farmers and agricultural workers struggle to identify plant diseases early, leading to significant crop loss, reduced yield, and economic impact. Traditional methods require expert knowledge and can be time-consuming, resulting in delayed treatment and widespread crop damage.

## Scope of the Project
- Develop an image-based disease identification system for common crops
- Support multiple crop types: Tomato, Potato, Corn
- Identify common diseases: Early Blight, Late Blight, Healthy plants
- Provide treatment recommendations for identified diseases
- Create a user-friendly web interface for easy access

## Target Users
1. **Small-scale Farmers**: Who lack access to agricultural experts
2. **Home Gardeners**: Growing vegetables in backyard gardens
3. **Agricultural Students**: Learning about plant diseases
4. **Farm Consultants**: Needing quick preliminary diagnosis

## High-level Features
1. **Image Upload Interface**: Simple drag-and-drop image upload
2. **Disease Detection**: AI-powered classification of plant diseases
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Probability scores for each potential disease
4. **Treatment Recommendations**: Actionable advice for identified diseases
5. **Multiple Crop Support**: Detection for various common crops
6. **REST API**: Backend service for potential mobile app integration
